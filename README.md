#Contacts

> A simple software to store friends information. First steps into python.


It's been a while so I decided to improve it a bit.

Includes the following features:

- cli interface.
- python 3.5.
- in memory search.
- csv storage.


## Usage

Create a virtualenv with python 3.5.

Install requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run this command for more information
`python contacts_cli.py --help`


## TODO

- Update a contact
- Remove a contact
- Tests
